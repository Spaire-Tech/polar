"""Course Assistant — the "brain" (Phase 0).

Pure, dependency-light building blocks for the AI version of a course's
creator (the "Office Hours" TA): turn the lessons + transcripts the creator
already uploaded into a grounded, voice-matched Claude assistant.

Design notes
------------
* **Import-light on purpose.** At module load this pulls in only the standard
  library, so the transcript / knowledge-base / prompt logic can be exercised
  and unit-tested without booting the rest of the app *or* importing the
  Anthropic SDK. The Anthropic client is imported lazily inside the functions
  that actually hit the API. (This also means the brain runs in environments
  where the heavier app stack can't be imported.)
* **Grounding + voice + guardrails** are the three layers from the design:
  - grounding: the course knowledge base is supplied as a *document* content
    block with citations enabled, so answers are tied to what was taught and
    every answer can point back to a lesson.
  - voice: a short "voice card" extracted from the creator's own transcripts
    is injected into the system prompt so answers sound like them.
  - guardrails: the system prompt keeps the TA in its lane and makes it say
    "the course doesn't cover that" instead of confabulating; a separate,
    cheap guardrail model call blocks clearly unsafe / out-of-domain input.
* **Prompt caching.** The stable prefix (system instructions + voice card, and
  the course document) carries ``cache_control`` breakpoints; the volatile
  student question is the trailing, uncached suffix.
