"""End-of-life owner for legacy card-less trials.

The old design auto-created local trialing subscriptions
(``user_metadata.managed_by = "trial"``, no payment method) at org
signup. Those rows are excluded from the billing scheduler on purpose,
and the cron that used to end them (``platform.expire_trials``) was
deleted with the card-required trial redesign — stranding any leftover
row in ``trialing`` forever: never charged, never lapsed, paid
entitlements granted for free, dashboard showing a stale trial date.

``lapse_stale_legacy_trials`` is the reinstated owner: it revokes
expired legacy trials through the real subscription service (webhooks,
benefit revocation, and fee resync all fire) and stamps
``trial_consumed_at`` on every customer who ever held one, so none of
them is handed a second free trial on re-subscribe.
