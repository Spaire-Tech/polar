"""Customer-portal notification type registry.

Each `NotificationType.render(...)` returns (subject, html_body) for the
email channel. The same payload is also stored on the customer_notifications
row so the bell dropdown can render a richer in-portal card from it.

For community.event.* types, the rendered HTML now flows through the
React Email pipeline (server/emails/src/emails/community_event_*.tsx)
so each email is org-branded and visually consistent with the rest of
our transactional surface (order confirmation, subscription receipts,
etc.). The legacy inline-HTML branches are kept as fall-backs in case
an in-flight queued job from before the upgrade reaches the worker
without the new payload fields."""

# Per-type channel policy. Notifications always create a bell row; this
# governs whether the same notification also sends an email.
#
# 15-minute reminders stay bell-only on purpose — by the time the email
# arrives in the inbox the window has often already started, and the
# notification arrives every event so the volume would be noisy.
#
# RSVP confirmations are intentionally NOT in this set even though they
# do send an email — the confirmation email carries an `.ics` attachment
# and so flows through a dedicated send path (community.events_tasks.
# rsvp_confirmed) rather than the generic customer_notification.send_email
# actor, which doesn't take attachments.
#
# EVENT_PUBLISHED is no longer in EMAIL_TYPES because the auto-fire on
# event creation got replaced by the host-composed announcement
# (EVENT_ANNOUNCEMENT). Old bell rows of EVENT_PUBLISHED stay
# renderable so the bell history still works — they just won't fire
# new emails. New flows enqueue EVENT_ANNOUNCEMENT instead.
#
# REPLAY_NAG_* types stay defined above (so any in-flight queued jobs
# render rather than crash) but the cron that enqueued them is gone —
# see community/events_tasks.py. They never appear in EMAIL_TYPES now.
