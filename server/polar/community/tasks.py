"""Background jobs for the Community module.

Two actors fan-out side-effects after a successful POST / reply:

  community.post.created
    Publishes a 'community.post.new' SSE event to every member of the
    course's organization (so the customer-portal feed query can
    invalidate live), and creates a CommunityPostNewOnCourseNotification
    bell for each creator-org user.

  community.comment.created
    Creates a CommunityPostReplyNotification bell for the author of the
    parent post (skipped when the replier IS the author — own-replies
    don't notify yourself).

  community.module_completed_listener
    Subscribes to course.module_completed (Chunk 6 added this event in
    polar/course/service.py); inserts a synthetic 'milestone' community
    post in the course's feed so the creator's milestones surface
    naturally in the timeline. No-op when community is disabled or
    milestones_enabled=false.

All actors live behind the standard Dramatiq pattern: low priority
(community is engagement, not money), idempotent (re-runs don't
duplicate bell rows or SSE events), and they swallow non-fatal errors
so a deletion mid-fanout doesn't poison the queue.
