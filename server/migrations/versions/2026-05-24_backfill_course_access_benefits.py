"""Backfill course_access benefits + enrollments for existing courses

Revision ID: 8e1f47a09c52
Revises: 4d2b6c91e0a3
Create Date: 2026-05-24 06:05:00.000000

Until today, creating a course never wired a `course_access` benefit on
the underlying product. The Order → enqueue_benefits_grants pipeline ran
correctly for every purchase, but found nothing to grant (the product
had no benefits of type course_access), so no CourseEnrollment row was
ever created — paying customers got nothing in the portal, and the
editor's Customers tab showed only the org admin.

This migration repairs every existing course in two steps:

  1. For each course whose product has no course_access benefit pointing
     at this course, create the benefit and attach it to the product.

  2. For each customer with a fulfilled (subscription-active OR
     one-time paid) order for that product, insert a CourseEnrollment
     row dated to the order/subscription start. The partial unique
     index on (customer_id, course_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL keeps
     this idempotent.

Going forward, course_service.create() wires the benefit at creation
time so this only ever needs to run once.
