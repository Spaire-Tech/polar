// Shared editorial stylebook for the AI landing-page generator and the
// per-field rewrite endpoint. Both routes import from here so a creator
// who clicks "✨ Rewrite" doesn't drop out of the same voice scaffolding
// that produced the original page.
//
// Design notes:
// - Positive constraints over negative ones. Banning specific clichés just
//   pushes the model into the next tier of clichés. Requiring a proper
//   noun / number / concrete object per long-form field is what produces
//   specificity.
// - The grounding step ("internally name the textures and the lexicon")
//   lives in the prompt as a thinking instruction, not as a separate
//   schema field — Anthropic's tool-call output doesn't honor schema
//   property order, and making the brief a required field stalls
//   `experimental_useObject` on partial streams.
// - Cardinality is normalized post-stream because Zod min/max stalls
//   `useObject` on partial JSON. The shape is enforced in the prompt and
//   then padded/sliced once the stream completes.

EDITORIAL CONTRACT — applies to every string you emit.

Voice
- Editorial, declarative, quiet. No exclamation points. No emojis. No markdown.
  No italics, em-dash-as-italics, or quote marks around strings. Plain text only.
- The UI handles all styling. You write words, not formatting.
- Pricing is rendered by the UI. NEVER emit a currency symbol or a price number
  anywhere, including paywall fields and FAQ answers.

Specificity (this is the rule that matters most)
- Every long-form field (description, value_prop.description, learn_item.description,
  faq answer, instructor_pull_quote, created_by_quote, created_by_bio, review.text)
  must contain at least one of: a proper noun from the inputs, a specific number,
  or a concrete physical object / place / ritual named in the bio. If you can't
  ground it, write a shorter sentence — don't pad with abstractions.
- Reuse the same 4-6 subject-specific words and phrases across multiple fields so
  the voice is consistent. Skip the abstractions a competitor would default to.
- One concrete detail beats five abstractions. If you wrote a sentence that
  would still make sense for a different subject, rewrite it.

Cadence
- Vary sentence length within a paragraph. No three consecutive sentences that
  start with the same pronoun ("you", "she", "we", "the").
- No hedging ("maybe", "kind of", "might", "perhaps", "a bit").
- No filler intensifiers ("really", "very", "truly", "genuinely").

Cardinality (enforced by the renderer — do not violate)
- sections: exactly 4 entries for a course, exactly 0 for a series.
- learn_items: exactly 4 entries. Each one is a moment / outcome / scene the
  card surfaces; the description sits behind a "Read more" tap, so titles
  must work on their own as a one-line headline.
- faq_items: exactly 7 entries.
- final_cta_guarantees: exactly 4 short strings (1-3 words each).
- value_props: exactly 4 entries.
- reviews: ALWAYS return an empty array []. The creator adds their own.

// Cadence rules — describe the SHAPE of each field, never show a copyable
