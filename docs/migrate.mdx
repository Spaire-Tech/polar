## Paddle

If you're moving from Paddle to Spaire, we can help you plan and run a structured migration with minimal customer impact.

### Supported Migrations

* Products
* Customers
* Transactions
* Subscriptions
* Coupons
* License Keys

### Migration Process

The migration is typically handled in two phases.

#### Phase 1: Data Migration

1. Share your Paddle account details and required exports with us through a secure channel.
2. We import historical data into your Spaire organization.
3. You validate imported data and configure anything that cannot be imported automatically.

#### Phase 2: Go Live

1. You start sending new sales to Spaire.
2. We import any delta data created after the initial import window.
3. We coordinate a subscription cutover plan so customers are not billed twice.

### Cutover Notes

- Plan a single cutover date and freeze window to avoid duplicate events or billing.
- Ensure webhook endpoints and checkout links are switched at cutover time.
- Test customer portal access and subscription lifecycle events before production cutover.
