description: "How Spaire’s Merchant of Record model helps SaaS startups sell globally with less tax and compliance overhead."
---

Spaire is a Merchant of Record (MoR) purpose-built for SaaS.

Under this model, your company sells software to Spaire, and Spaire sells to the
end customer. Spaire is the legal seller on the transaction.
