## Connect Payout Account

You need to setup an account so that we can issue [payouts](/features/finance/payouts).

1. Go to the `Finance` page in your Spaire dashboard
2. Click `Setup` in the card shown above in your dashboard
3. Choose account type & follow their setup instructions

_This is only required the first time and you can do this proactively too in order - recommended to avoid any additional delays._

### Stripe Connect Express

Stripe is the default and recommended option since it enables instant transfers.
