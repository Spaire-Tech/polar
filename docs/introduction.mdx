## What is Spaire?

Spaire is the financial and legal backbone for SaaS startups.

We act as your Merchant of Record — handling global tax compliance, billing, subscriptions, payouts, and customer lifecycle management — so your team can focus on product and growth instead of payments infrastructure.

## Why SaaS Teams Choose Spaire

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Global tax and compliance are operationally heavy" icon="building-columns">
    Cross-border SaaS revenue creates immediate VAT, GST, and sales tax complexity.
    Spaire centralizes tax calculation, collection, and remittance so your team can
    stay focused on product and growth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Billing systems are often fragmented" icon="gears">
    Most teams stitch together payment gateways, tax engines, invoicing,
    entitlement logic, and support tooling. Spaire provides a unified platform
    for subscriptions, metered billing, checkout, discounts, and lifecycle
    management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revenue-to-payout latency hurts velocity" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Traditional flows can delay access to earned funds. Spaire includes payout
    capabilities so revenue operations and business spending can move faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manual entitlement workflows don't scale" icon="box-open-full">
    License provisioning and entitlement access are automated with built-in
