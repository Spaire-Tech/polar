## What is Spaire?

Spaire is the financial and legal operating system for SaaS startups.

We combine a Merchant of Record model with billing, tax, compliance, payouts, and customer lifecycle tooling so small teams can sell globally without assembling a fragmented stack.

## Why SaaS Teams Choose Spaire

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Global tax and compliance are operationally heavy" icon="building-columns">
    Cross-border SaaS revenue creates immediate VAT, GST, and sales tax complexity.
    Spaire centralizes tax calculation, collection, and remittance so your team can
    stay focused on product and growth.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Billing systems are often fragmented" icon="gears">
    Most teams stitch together payment gateways, tax engines, invoicing,
    entitlement logic, and support tooling. Spaire provides a unified platform
    for subscriptions, metered billing, checkout, discounts, and lifecycle
    management.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revenue-to-spend latency hurts velocity" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Traditional flows can delay access to earned funds. Spaire includes finance
    and payout capabilities so revenue operations and business spending can run
    on the same platform.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manual entitlement workflows don’t scale" icon="box-open-full">
    License provisioning, file access, and gated community/repository access are
    automated with built-in benefits and APIs, keeping payment state and user
    access synchronized.
  </Accordion>
