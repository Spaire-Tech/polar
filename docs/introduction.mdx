## What is Spaire?

Spaire is a Merchant of Record built for SaaS.

We become the legal seller to your customers. That means we manage global tax collection and remittance, handle regulatory obligations, and operate the billing layer behind your product.

You keep building. We run the financial and compliance engine underneath.

## Why SaaS Teams Choose Spaire

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building-columns" title="Global tax and compliance are operationally heavy">
    Cross-border SaaS revenue creates immediate VAT, GST, and sales tax complexity. Spaire centralizes tax calculation, collection, and remittance so your team can stay focused on product and growth.

  <Accordion icon="gears" title="Billing systems are often fragmented">
    Most teams stitch together payment gateways, tax engines, invoicing, entitlement logic, and support tooling. Spaire provides a unified platform for subscriptions, metered billing, checkout, discounts, and lifecycle management.
